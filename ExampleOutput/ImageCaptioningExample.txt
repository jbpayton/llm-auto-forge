Thought: The user wants me to identify what's in an image and add a caption to it. I need to check if I have a tool that can perform image recognition and add captions to images. I'll use the tool_query_tool to check for unregistered tools that can perform these tasks.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "tool_query_tool",
  "action_input": {
    "tool_description": "image recognition",
    "agent_name": "ToolMaker"
  }
}

Number of requested results 4 is greater than number of elements in index 2, updating n_results = 2
Observation: The following tools may be helpful, they have not yet been registered and can be registered with the tool_registration_tool:
["'Description':This tool performs a Google Image Search using the Search API and returns a list of image URLs.,{'tool_filename': 'GoogleImageSearch.py', 'tool_name': 'google_image_search'}", "'Description':This tool displays an image from a given local file path.,{'tool_filename': 'ImageDisplayer.py', 'tool_name': 'image_displayer'}"]
Thought:The tools available for image recognition are not sufficient for the task at hand. I need a tool that can not only recognize the content of an image but also add a caption to it. I will need to create a new tool for this task. Before I start, I should read the ToolTemplate.py file to understand the structure of a tool. I'll use the read_file tool to do this.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "read_file",
  "action_input": {

```The output directory './TestOutput' has been created successfully. Now I can run the 'image_recognition_and_captioning' tool again to perform the task. The task is to identify what's in the image at './TestInput/mystery_image.jpg' and add a caption to it. The captioned image should be written to './TestOutput/captioned_image.jpg'.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "image_recognition_and_captioning",
  "action_input": {
    "image_path": "./TestInput/mystery_image.jpg",
    "output_path": "./TestOutput/captioned_image.jpg"
  }
}

Using a pipeline without specifying a model name and revision in production is not recommended.

Observation: Finished running tool.
