# llm-auto-forge
A langchain based tool to allow agents to dynamically create, use, store, and retrieve tools to solve real world problems


While not directly inspired by this project, a due dilligence search (conducted on 8/1/2023) showed that this team from Google DeepMind and Princeton did something similar (https://github.com/ctlllll/LLM-ToolMaker). Despite this, I intend to proceed due to my focus being less an academic "can it work" interest, and more of a "can I get this to solve real world problems" interest.

Anyway, here's to a faster takeoff.
